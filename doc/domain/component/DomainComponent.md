The DomainComponent class is an abstract class, example subclasses
include Element, Node, SP_Constraint, MP_Constraint, NodalLoad,
ElementalLoad. Each object of these types is a component of an enclosing
Domain object. The DomainComponent class provides methods to set and
retrieve a pointer to the enclosing Domain object.
### Constructor

### Destructor

### Public Methods



```{.cpp}
DomainComponent(int tag, int classTag);
```


Constructs a DomainComponent with a tag given by `tag`, whose class tag
is given by *classTag*. The tag of a component is some unique means of
identifying the component among like components, i.e. the tag of a node
would be its unique node number. The `classTag`{.cpp} is a means of
identifying the class of the object. No domain is associated with the
object. The integer `tag` is passed to the TaggedObject constructor and
the integer `classTag`{.cpp} is passed to the MovableObject constructor.

```{.cpp}
virtualÂ  $\tilde{}$DomainComponent();
```


Does nothing. Provided so subclasses destructor's will always be
called.

```{.cpp}
virtual void setDomain(Domain \*theDomain);
```


Sets the encompassing domain of the component to that given by
*theDomain*. This method is invoked by `theDomain`{.cpp} when the component is
being added to the domain, in an *addDomain..* invocation (see interface
for Domain).\

```{.cpp}
virtual Domain \*getDomain(void) const;
```


Returns a pointer to the Domain to which the component was added, or $0$
if the `setDomain()`{.cpp} command was never called on the object.
To cause the object to display itself using *theRenderer*. The integer
*displayMode* is used to indicate what is to be displayed and the float
*fact* is used to factor the nodal displacements. To return $0$ if
successful, a negative number if not. This base class simply returns
$0$. Its up to the subclasses to override this method if the objects are
to be rendered.
