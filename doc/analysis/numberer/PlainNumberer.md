MovableObject

DOF_Numberer

The PlainNumberer class is a DOF_Numberer. An object of this class
assigns the equation numbers to thee DOF_Groups based on the order in
which they are obtained from the DOF_GroupIter object obtained from the
AnalyisModel. The class is useful for situations where the SystemOfEqn
or Solver objects will impose a renumbering on the equations, which
makes performing a complex numbering of the degrees-of-freedom a waste
of computational effort.
### Constructor


```{.cpp}
PlainNumberer();
```

### Destructor


```{.cpp}
virtualÂ  $\tilde{}$PlainNumberer();
```

### Public Methods


```{.cpp}
virtual int numberDOF(int lastDOF_Group = -1);
```



```{.cpp}
virtual int numberDOF(ID &lastDOF_Groups);
```





The integer `NUMBERER_TAG_PlainNumberer`{.cpp} is passed to the DOF_Numberer
classes constructor.

Does nothing.

```{.cpp}
virtual int numberDOF(int lastDOF_Group = -1);
```


The PlainNumberer will twice obtain the DOF_GroupIter from the
AnalysisModel. It iterates twice through the DOF_Groups first assigning
the dofs with eqn numbers assigned -2 a number and then on the next pass
the dofs assigned -3. The PlainNumberer then invokes `setID()`{.cpp} on each
FE_Element in the AnalysisModel. Finally it invokes *setEqnNum(numEqn)*
on the AnalyisModel. Returns a positive integer equal to the last
equation number set if successful, a negative number if not; the value
of which depends on the type of the PlainNumberer. A PlainNumberer will
not use the `lastDOF_Group`{.cpp} integer, if one is supplied a warning
message is printed.\

```{.cpp}
virtual int numberDOF(ID &lastDOF_Groups);
```


The method is identical to that outlined above. A PlainNumberer will not
use the `lastDOF_Groups`{.cpp} ID, if this method is invoked a warning message
is printed.
Returns $0$.\
*virtual int recvSelf(int commitTag, Channel &theChannel,
FEM_ObjectBroker &theBroker);*

Returns $0$.
